some more MODIFICATIONS can be made but due to lack of time i could not do them. some of them are:
   adding more features to this app.
   also adding links of books and scanned copies of notes when one searches for a particular book or notes, since our purpose it to help the user get the item he wants may be a softcopy if    getting a hardcopy is getting tough
   and ofcourse there are many more.

EXPLANATION OF MY CODE:
  i have made in the first screen i.e. for sign up
  it takes user's input so that gets to know about the locality and possible choices of user.
  if you press "signup" it takes you to the next screen.
  the next screen shows a model layout of how the after login screen will look like.
  when you press"logout" it brings you back to the login page.
